We have created a number of software packages that are available as open source software:

* [OscaR](https://bitbucket.org/oscarlib/oscar/wiki/Home): constraint programming in Scala
* [MiniCP](http://www.minicp.org): lightweight constraint programming in Java
* [CP4DM](https://sites.uclouvain.be/cp4dm/): constraints for data mining in OscaR

Online demos of some of our tools will also be available here in the near future.
